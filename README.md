## Before

This's Loss J.'s statistical machine learning action course project.   
You can learn to use Numpy, sklearn, TensorFlow 2.x and Pytorch 1.x 
to build various common statistical machine learning models.
Of course, the principles of the model will be supplemented appropriately.

This course is designed to familiarize you with the basic APIs 
of computing frameworks such as TensorFlow, strengthen coding skills, 
and help you develop statistical machine learning intuition.

Maybe you can’t wait to learn this course, just click 
[here](https://space.bilibili.com/161784330)，then you can start 
learning this course. 
By the way, don’t forget to follow me, give the video a like, 
bookmark the video, and coin the video. Your support is the biggest 
motivation for me to make courses, thank you!

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repositories.  
2. Install the necessary packages.  
```bash
cd Statistical-Machine-Learning && pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It is recommended that you **create an independent virtual environment**
and run this installation command in the virtual environment to avoid 
conflicts with your own Python environment.
